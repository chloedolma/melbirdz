Australian Magpie,Gymnorhina tibicen,"Magpies are one of Australia's most highly-regarded songbirds. They have a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex, and their pitch may vary over up to four octaves. The Australian Magpie is black and white, but the plumage pattern varies across its range. Its nape, upper tail and shoulder are white in males, grey in females. Across most of Australia, the remainder of the body is black. In the south-east, centre, extreme south-west and Tasmania, the back and rump are entirely white. The eye of adult birds is chestnut brown.",https://fieldofmar-e.schools.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/doe/sws/schools/f/fieldofmar-e/image/B74EE0AA-0529-4F4A-A21E-F3CCA1BA1752.jpeg.thumb.1280.1280.jpg,
Australian White Ibis,Threskiornis molucca,"Some Australian White Ibis populations have learnt to exploit artificial foods in urban environments and are becoming pests. However, although Australian White Ibises are becoming more common in some areas, their abundance is decreasing in their natural range. The Australian White Ibis is identified by its almost entirely white body plumage and black head and neck. The head is featherless and its black bill is long and down-curved. During the breeding season the small patch of skin on the under-surface of the wing changes from dull pink to dark scarlet. Adult birds have a tuft of cream plumes on the base of the neck. Females differ from males by being slightly smaller, with shorter bills. Young birds are similar to adults, but have the neck covered with black feathers. In flight, flocks of Australian White Ibis form distinctive V-shaped flight patterns. Another common name for this bird is Sacred Ibis, but this more appropriately refers to a closely related African species.

Common Myna,Acridotheres tristis,"The Common Myna's success is mostly a result of its opportunistic behaviour and aggressiveness towards other species, bullying them around food sources and out competing them for nesting sites. The Common Myna is brown with a black head. It has a yellow bill, legs and bare eye skin. In flight it shows large white wing patches. The Common Myna is closely associated with human habitation. In the evening, large groups of Common Mynas gather in communal roosts, mainly in the non-breeding season, in roof voids, bridges, and large trees, and numbers can reach up to several thousands.

Common Starling,Sturnus vulgaris,"Flocks of Common Starlings are often seen at dusk wheeling in large circles as they search for a roosting site for the night. Once a common bird of European deciduous woodlands (now in more rural and urban areas), the Common Starling was introduced into Australia in the late 1850s through to 1870. It has become well established and is expanding its range. The Common Starling has a wide variation in plumage.
